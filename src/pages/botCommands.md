<center>My name is Sha and I'm the developer of this website.</center>

I enjoy doing personal projects that challenge me to expand and further my knowledge of programming. I'm typically writing anything, and everything in javascript but I do dabble from time to time in other languages. I'm also messing around with frameworks all the time - a couple of my favorite larger frameworks I've discovered would be [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
