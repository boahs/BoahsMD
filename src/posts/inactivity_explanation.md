## Been busy!

Hey! If you're one of the 41 people who visit the site daily...as seen in the cover image, perhaps you **might** wonder why I haven't made a post in almost 2 years. 

### But wait

The cover image is a lie. It is a report from from the website [worth of web](https://www.worthofweb.com/website-value/boahs.info/) and I sadly admit that I recieve around 10% of the report according to google analytics which is actually accurate. Hey... I'm not complaining though, because it seems the SEO works just fine considering I don't advertise this website anywhere.

The reason I haven't really had time to post any new content is I've been very busy over the past year. I started a new job last year as a quality assurance engineer and still work there to this very day. To say the least it's kept me on my toes and I've learned a massive amount of SQL and working with teams over that time. 

The fact that I've been extremely busy doesn't mean I'm not actively developing in my free time though. In that span of time I've learned a lot about APIs as well and used that knowledge to create various bots utilizing various popular frameworks such as TMI.JS, Discord.js, twitters API, reddits API... 

This post is going to be short and sweet. Just letting anyone that actually visits the website to know I'm very grateful that you're spending time learning about previous things I've posted! I'll hopefully in the short future be able to start updating this more and posting about all kinds of cool things that I've created. Step by step tutorials maybe. 

Take care,
**â€” Boahs**
